The output is enabled when the voltage applied to EN is greater than V EN(HI) and disabled when the applied voltage is less than V EN(LOW) . If external control of the output voltage is not needed, connect EN to IN. This device has a smart enable circuit to reduce quiescent current. When the voltage on the enable pin is driven above V EN(HI), the output is enabled and the smart enable internal pulldown resistor (R EN(PULLDOWN) ) is disconnected. When the enable pin is floating, the R EN(PULLDOWN) is connected and pulls the enable pin low to disable the output. In addition to reducing quiescent current, the smart pulldown helps make sure that the logic level is correct even when EN is driven from a source that has limited current drive capability. The R value is listed in the Electrical Characteristics table.",
