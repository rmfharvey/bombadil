    "description": "Low Quiescent Current Ideal Diode Controller. The LTC4372 is a positive high voltage ideal diode controller that drives an external N-channel MOSFET to replace a Schottky diode. It controls the forward voltage drop across the MOSFET to ensure current delivery or current transfer from one path to the other even at light loads. A 5uA operating current achieves high efficiency for intermittent load applications or always-on backup power supplies. If a power source fails or is shorted, a fast turnoff minimizes reverse current transients. The LTC4372 controls back-to-back N-channel MOSFETs for inrush current control and load switching. The SHDN pin keeps the MOSFET off and reduces quiescent current to 3.5uA. Wide operating voltage range of 2.5V to 80V with reverse supply protection to -28V.",
