    "description": "High-Side OR-ing FET Controller. The LM5050-1/-Q1 operates in conjunction with an external MOSFET as an ideal diode rectifier when connected in series with a power source. This ORing controller allows MOSFETs to replace diode rectifiers in power distribution networks thus reducing both power loss and voltage drops. Features: Wide operating input voltage range (5V to 75V, 100V transient capable), charge pump gate driver for external N-Channel MOSFET, fast 50ns response to current reversal, 2A peak gate turnoff current, minimum VDS clamp for faster turnoff.",
