  "detailed_description": "ACUV (AC Undervoltage Comparator Input) is a pin used to program the undervoltage protection for the AC input voltage. When the voltage at the ACUV pin falls below a specific threshold (VREF_ACUV), the device enters input voltage regulation, reducing the charge current. If the ACUV pin voltage continues to fall below another threshold (VREF_ACUV), the device will stop the charging process.",
  "functionality": "The primary function of the ACUV pin is to set the AC undervoltage protection threshold. If this pin is not used for programming the undervoltage protection, it should be pulled to the VAC pin to utilize the device's internal AC operating window.",
  "connectivity": "The ACUV pin should be connected to a resistor divider from the VAC pin to PGND. This resistor divider sets the undervoltage protection threshold. If the pin is not used for programming, it should be tied to the VAC pin.",
  "connected_components": [
    {
      "component_name": "Resistor Divider",
      "details": "A resistor divider network is connected from the VAC pin to PGND, with the ACUV pin connected to the junction of two resistors (RAC1 and RAC2 as per Figure 8-1). The values of these resistors determine the undervoltage threshold. The formula provided is: V_{ACUV\_TARGET} = V_{REF\_ACUV} \\times \\frac{RAC1 + RAC2 + RAC3}{RAC2 + RAC3}"
    }
  ],
  "precautions": "If the ACUV programming is not used, the pin must be tied to the VAC pin to ensure proper operation and to enable the internal AC operating window. Failure to do so may lead to incorrect operation or prevent the device from functioning as expected."
