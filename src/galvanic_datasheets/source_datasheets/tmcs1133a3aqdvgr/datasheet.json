VS determines the full-scale output range of the analog output VOUT, and can be supplied with any voltage between 3V and 5.5V. To filter noise in the power-supply path, place a low-ESR decoupling capacitor of 0.1\u00b5F between VS and GND pins as close as possible to the supply and ground pins of the device. More decoupling capacitance can be added to compensate for noisy or high-impedance power supplies. When used in extremely noisy environments, ferrite beads can be added close to the supply pin as shown in Figure 9-4 to target and suppress high-frequency noise coupled on to system supply.\nThe TMCS1133 power supply VS can be sequenced independently of current flowing through the input. However, there is a power-on delay between VS reaching the recommended operating voltage and the analog output validation. During this power-on time, the output voltage VOUT can transition between GND and VS as the output transfers from a high impedance reset state to the active drive state. If this behavior must be avoided, then provide a stable supply voltage VS for longer than the power-on time prior to applying input current."

            "alert_output_signal":"The active-low ALERT output signal can be used to decipher which of four diagnostic states the TMCS1133 resides. As shown in Figure 8-8, the duty cycle of the 8kHz PWM output signal indicates which, neither, or both of the thermal and sensor operating condition warnings exist.",
            "sensor_alert":"In addition to temperature, sensor sensitivity and offset are constantly being monitored inside the TMCS1133. A sensor alert occurs in the unlikely event Hall sensor sensitivity or offset is out of range compared with factory set limits.",
            "thermal_alert":"As discussed in the Safe Operating Area section, high levels of input current can generate excessive heat inside the TMCS1133. High input currents, coupled with elevated ambient temperatures and printed circuit board thermal design can cause the TMCS1133 to overheat and be permanently damaged by exceeding maximum allowed junction temperatures. A thermal alert occurs when the internal temperature approaches the maximum allowed junction temperature."
          },
          "temperature_stability":"The TMCS1133 includes a proprietary temperature compensation technique which results in significantly improved parametric drift across the full temperature range. This compensation technique accounts for changes in ambient temperature, self-heating, and package stress. A zero-drift signal chain architecture along with Hall sensor temperature compensation methods enable stable sensitivity while minimizing offset errors across temperature. System-level performance is drastically improved across required operating conditions."
        },
        "input_isolation":"The separation between the input conductor and the Hall sensor die due to the TMCS1133 construction provides inherent galvanic isolation between package pins 1 and 2 on the high-voltage input side, and package pins 3 through 10 on the low-voltage output side. Insulation capability is defined according to certification agency definitions and using industry-standard test methods as defined in Section 6.6. Assessment of device lifetime working voltages follow the IEC 60747-17 standard for basic and reinforced insulation, requiring time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) data-projection are based on projected failure rates of less than 1 part per million (ppm) for reinforced insulation and less than 1000ppm for basic insulation, and a minimum insulation lifetime of 30 years. For reinforced insulation, the IEC 60747-17 standard also requires additional safety margins of 20% for working voltage, and 50% for insulation lifetime, translating into a minimum required lifetime of 30 years at 800V RMS for the TMCS1133. Figure 8-2 shows the intrinsic capability of the isolation barrier to withstand high-voltage stress over the lifetime of the device. Based on the TDDB data, the intrinsic capability of these devices is 670V RMS with a lifetime > 20 years. Other factors such as operating environment and pollution degree can further limit the working voltage of the component in an end system."
      },
      "overview":"The TMCS1133 is a precision Hall-effect current sensor, providing high levels of reliable reinforced isolation working voltage, ambient field rejection and high current carrying capability. A maximum total lifetime error of less than 1.4% can be achieved with no system level calibration, or less than 1% maximum total error can be achieved with a one-time room temperature calibration (including both temperature and lifetime drift). Numerous device options are provided for both unidirectional and bidirectional current measurements. The input current flows through a conductor between the isolated input current pins. The conductor has a 0.7m\u03a9 resistance at room temperature and accommodates up to 44A RMS of continuous current at 125\u00b0C ambient temperature when used with printed circuit boards of comparable thermal design, such as the TMCS1133xEVM. The low-ohmic leadframe path reduces power dissipation compared to alternative current measurement methodologies, and does not require any external passive components, isolated supplies, or control signals on the high-voltage side. The magnetic field generated by the input current is sensed by a Hall sensor and amplified by a precision signal chain. The device can be used for both AC and DC current measurements and has a bandwidth of 1MHz. There are multiple fixed-sensitivity device options to choose from, providing a wide variety of bidirectional linear current sensing ranges from \u00b110A to \u00b196A, as well as unidirectional linear current sensing ranges from 19A to 183A. The TMCS1133 can operate with a low voltage supply ranging from 3V to 5.5V, and is optimized for high accuracy and temperature stability, with both offset and sensitivity compensated across the entire operating temperature range."

Figure 7-4 shows the maximum continuous current-handling capability of the device when mounted on the TMCS1133xEVM. Current capability falls off at higher ambient temperatures because of the reduced thermal transfer from junction-to-ambient and increased power dissipation in the leadframe. By improving the thermal design of an application, the SOA can be extended to higher currents at elevated temperatures. Using larger and heavier copper power planes, providing air flow over the board, or adding heat sinking structures to the area of the device can all improve thermal performance."
