When enabled (driven high), it activates functions like high-accuracy current sensing via the SNS pin and open-load detection. It also allows for off-state diagnostics. When disabled (driven low or floating), diagnostic features are turned off, and the device enters a very low power standby mode if the EN pin is also low, significantly reducing quiescent current.

The FAULT and SNS pins are set to a high-impedance state. If the EN pin is also low, the device enters a low-power standby mode with less than 0.5 \u00b5A of standby current.

The voltage level applied to the DIAG_EN pin directly influences the maximum voltage (VSNSFH) on the SNS analog output pin; the system designer must ensure the MCU's ADC can handle this voltage. If diagnostic features are required for the application, the DIAG_EN pin must be actively driven high by an external source like an MCU, as leaving the pin floating will disable diagnostics due to the internal pulldown resistor. Disabling diagnostics (DIAG_EN low) also puts the FAULT and SNS pins into a high-impedance state, making fault information unavailable to the MCU, although internal protections like current limit and thermal shutdown remain active."

        "detailed_description":"The SNS pin provides an analog current output for real-time load monitoring and diagnostics. It uses an internal current mirror to source a current that is proportional to the main output load current (IOUT). The ratio of the output current to the sense current is defined by the constant K_SNS (typically 1300 A/A). This sense current is converted to a voltage by an external resistor (RSNS) connected from the SNS pin to ground. The pin also serves as a fault indicator; during fault conditions such as overcurrent, thermal shutdown, overvoltage, or off-state open-load, the pin's voltage is actively driven to a fault level, V_SNSFH. The value of V_SNSFH scales with the voltage applied to the DIAG_EN pin, protecting the connected microcontroller's ADC input from overvoltage without needing external Zener diodes.",
        "functionality":"The pin has two primary functions based on the device's operational state:\n1. **Analog Current Sense:** During normal operation with the EN and DIAG_EN pins high, the SNS pin outputs a current equal to IOUT / K_SNS. The voltage across the external sense resistor is therefore proportional to the load current, allowing for measurement by an MCU's ADC.\n2. **Fault Indication:** Under various fault conditions (e.g., overcurrent, thermal shutdown, off-state open-load), the pin's output is forced to a specific fault voltage level (V_SNSFH), providing a clear diagnostic signal to the MCU. When the DIAG_EN pin is disabled (low), the SNS pin is in a high-impedance state.",

          "The current sense feature is only active when the DIAG_EN pin is enabled (high). If DIAG_EN is low, the SNS output is high-impedance.",

          "The fault voltage level (V_SNSFH) scales with the voltage on the DIAG_EN pin. This relationship must be understood to correctly interpret the ADC readings.",
