The node between the SNS pin and R_SNS is then connected to a microcontroller's ADC input. It is recommended to place a series protection resistor (R_PROT) between this node and the ADC input. A filter capacitor (C_FILTER) can be placed from the ADC input to ground to form a low-pass filter. If the SNS pin is not used in the application, it should be connected to ground through a 1-k\u03a9 resistor.",
        "detailed_description":"The SNS pin is a multi-function analog output used for current sensing and fault diagnostics. In normal operation, it sources a current that is proportional to the main high-side switch's output current (I_OUT) by a fixed ratio, K_SNS (typically 1/1300). This sense current is converted to a voltage by an external resistor (R_SNS) for measurement by a microcontroller's ADC. Under fault conditions, such as overcurrent, thermal shutdown, or off-state open-load, the pin outputs a specific fault voltage level (V_SNSFH) to signal the error to the microcontroller.",
        "functionality":"The pin's function is determined by the device's operating state and the state of the DIAG_EN pin:\n1. **Analog Current Sense:** When the device is operating normally (no faults) and the DIAG_EN pin is logic HIGH, the SNS pin sources a current equal to I_OUT / K_SNS.\n2. **Fault Indication:** Under fault conditions and with DIAG_EN logic HIGH, the SNS pin is driven to a fault voltage level, V_SNSFH. This fault voltage scales with the voltage applied to the DIAG_EN pin itself, helping to protect the connected ADC input.\n3. **High-Impedance State:** When the DIAG_EN pin is logic LOW, the current sense and diagnostic features are disabled, and the SNS pin is in a high-impedance state.",
        "precautions":"The value of the sense resistor (R_SNS) is critical. It must be selected so that the voltage at the maximum measurable load current is sufficiently below the fault voltage (V_SNSFH) to allow the system to distinguish between a high current condition and a fault. The current sense functionality is only active when the DIAG_EN pin is HIGH. The system designer must be aware that the SNS pin reports faults by outputting a voltage level, not a proportional current. The integrated feature of V_SNSFH scaling with V_DIAG_EN removes the need for external protection like a Zener diode but must be considered in the design."

The voltage on this pin is used for off-state diagnostics. For instance, in an open-load condition, VOUT is pulled up towards VS, which the device detects as a fault.\n- **Inductive Load Turn-off:** When switching off an inductive load, an internal clamp activates to limit the voltage between VS and VOUT (VDS,clamp), safely dissipating the stored inductive energy and protecting the internal FET.",
